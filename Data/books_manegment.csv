Discovering the Pulse of India's Telecom Innovations,"Why include Satellite industry stock in your portfolio? The satellite services market was valued at $126.5 billion in 2018 and remains expected to reach $144.5 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 2.2% from 2019 to 2026. Satellite service providers offer satellite capacity to end-users such as DTH operators, telecommunication companies, and others. These providers buy capacity from the satellite operators to resell voice, broadcasting, and data circuits to several end-user industries. The satellite services market remains anticipated to grow significantly during the forecast period owing to numerous factors, such as increased demand for earth observation services in multiple sectors. When is the best time to put money into this industry? SIA-India expects India's market share in the global satellite industry pie to rise from 2 percent in 2021 to 10 percent before 2030. The global satcom market remains scheduled to increase from $65.68 billion in 2020 to $131.68 billion in 2028, a CAGR of 9.1 percent. Experts say higher private sector participation is going to drive this growth. At the launch of the space body ISpA (Indian Space Association), PM Narendra Modi said that Indian space had remained dominated by a single umbrella of Indian government and government institutions. Still, there is a need to have no restrictions on Indian talent, whether it is in the public or private sector. It is a fast-moving area. Much trust has remained put in the private sector coming into space. Policies have to be revised. Technology has remained shared. The next few years will be critical to ensure private enterprises can contribute meaningfully. How are Satellite companies regulated? The ITU Radio Regulations and ITU Constitution (No. 197 of Article 45) provide that ""all stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members, recognized operating agencies, or other authorized operating agencies which carry on a radio service, and which operate following the Radio Regulations"". In part due to the growth of satellite constellations, space generally, and GSO slots more specifically, are becoming increasingly crowded. There is, therefore, more significant potential for radio interference between services, as well as space junk or space debris, and the issue of what to do with all the satellites as they reach the end of their working life – retrieving obsolete satellites and launchers is becoming a more significant issue. What is the future of this industry? India is one of the world's following big markets for satellite technology applications. But when it comes to investing a considerable amount of taxpayer's money in space, the government has to think twice before allocating higher amounts of budget, mainly due to the country's other earthly issues. On the other hand, a partnership or an agreement with foreign nations such as the United States will help the country to accelerate its private satellite technology presence on a global scale. Though currently, India has to take a bottom-to-top approach in scaling up the upstream personal satellite sector capabilities, the downstream market already has a significant amount of rolling satellite applications in broadcasting, remote sensing, disaster management, etc. Therefore, taking thorough advantage of the existing downstream capabilities and accordingly iterating the future market supply and demand will result in healthy growth of the private Indian satellite companies.

Changing composition of private investment in Indian agriculture and its relationship with public investment and input subsidies,"Using the decennial All-India Debt and Investment Survey from 1981-82 to 2012-13, this paper delves into the spatial and temporal trends in private fixed capital expenditure and its composition, among rural households in India. We also assess its relationship with public investment in agriculture. Amidst sizeable ups and downs, the magnitude and rate of growth in private investment in agriculture has gained momentum from 2000s except in Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir. An increasing preference of farmers to invest in residential land and buildings, and that at the cost of asset formation in farm business, is evident in agriculturally advanced states. Within agriculture, relatively higher investments in land improvement, machinery-implements, tractors, and livestock are identified over the period. Importantly, such investments are positively influenced by public investments in agriculture and irrigation in the high and low income states and also by public spending on input subsidy in the middle and low income states. An increase in public expenditure that is well targeted and is commensurate with farmers’ investment portfolio would reinforce a complementary relation between the two across-the-board. The impact of terms of trade on private investment though positive turns out to be statistically insignificant. Land acts as a constraint, indicating need for policy interventions that augment crop yield and can bring remunerative prices to farmers. A continued effort to improve the outreach of formal financial institutions for credit is warranted for higher private capital formation.","Kumar, Anjani",Finance,2020-01-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2SbNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Health Financing Policy,"The global movement toward universal health coverage (UHC) is accompanied by requests for large increases in government health spending in some countries. This combined with the global economic situation and stagnant economic growth across many low- and middle-income countries make it more critical than ever to place health financing discussions firmly in the context of macroeconomic and fiscal realities. Unfortunately, there is often a disconnect in decision making, with key fiscal decisions made in the absence of a clear understanding on the one hand of the potential consequences for the health sector, and on the other, the consequences for the country’s macroeconomic and fiscal position of increasing or reallocating government spending. Constructive health financing policy dialogue aims to reach a common understanding between health sector leaders and central budget authorities about policy objectives for the health sector and the resources needed to achieve those objectives, how much priority will be given to health in the government budget, and how the health sector will be held accountable for using funds effectively. This common understanding should be built on a realistic picture of the country’s macroeconomic and fiscal context, the constraints and competing priorities in the budget-setting process. When ministries of health and ministries of finance have a common understanding of macroeconomic and fiscal constraints, discussions can focus productively on using funds within the potential health resource envelope in the most effective way to achieve health system objectives. This guidance note outlines the key components of the macroeconomic, fiscal, and public financial management context that need to be considered for an informed health financing discussion at the country level. The guidance note is organized around four sets of questions that are key to placing the health financing dialogue in the context of a country’s macroeconomic and fiscal context. Each section points to measures, resources, and analytical tools that are available to assist in answering these questions for a specific country. The guidance note draws on case studies from 11 countries moving toward or sustaining universal health coverage conducted as part of the Japan†“World Bank Partnership Program on UHC as well as from other country examples.",Cheryl Cashin,Finance,2016-02-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qlm7CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Health Financing in Indonesia,"In 2004 the Indonesian government made a commitment to provide its entire population with health insurance coverage through a mandatory public health insurance scheme. It has moved boldly already provides coverage to an estimated 76.4 million poor and near poor, funded through the public budget. Nevertheless, over half the population still lacks health insurance coverage, and the full fiscal impacts of the government's program for the poor have not been fully assessed or felt. In addition, significant deficiencies in the efficiency and equity of the current health system, unless addressed will exacerbate cost pressures and could preclude the effective implementation of universal coverage (Ue and the desired result of improvements in population health outcomes and financial protection. For Indonesia to achieve UC, systems' performance must be improved and key policy choices with respect to the configuration of the health financing system must be made. Indonesia's health system performs well with respect to some health outcomes and financial protection, but there is potential for significant improvement. High-level political decisions are necessary on key elements of the health financing reform package. The key transitional questions to get there include: [ the benefits that can be afforded and their impacts on health outcomes and financial protection; [ how the more than 50 percent of those currently without coverage will be insured; [ how to pay medical care providers to assure access, efficiency, and quality; [ developing a streamlined and efficient administrative structure; [ how to address the current supply constraints to assure availability of promised services; [ how to raise revenues to finance the system, including the program for the poor as well as currently uninsured groups that may require government subsidization such as the more than 60 million informal sector workers, the 85 percent of workers in firms of less than five employees, and the 70 percent of the population living in rural areas.",,Finance,2009-01-01,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1enG1n8oC8IC&dq=Healthy+Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

TCP/IP Sockets in Java,"The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a ""gotchas"" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program.

SQL Tuning,"A poorly performing database application not only costs users time, but also has an impact on other applications running on the same computer or the same network. SQL Tuning provides an essential next step for SQL developers and database administrators who want to extend their SQL tuning expertise and get the most from their database applications.There are two basic issues to focus on when tuning SQL: how to find and interpret the execution plan of an SQL statement and how to change SQL to get a specific alternate execution plan. SQL Tuning provides answers to these questions and addresses a third issue that's even more important: how to find the optimal execution plan for the query to use.Author Dan Tow outlines a timesaving method he's developed for finding the optimum execution plan--rapidly and systematically--regardless of the complexity of the SQL or the database platform being used. You'll learn how to understand and control SQL execution plans and how to diagram SQL queries to deduce the best execution plan for a query. Key chapters in the book include exercises to reinforce the concepts you've learned. SQL Tuning concludes by addressing special concerns and unique solutions to ""unsolvable problems.""Whether you are a programmer who develops SQL-based applications or a database administrator or other who troubleshoots poorly tuned applications, SQL Tuning will arm you with a reliable and deterministic method for tuning your SQL queries to gain optimal performance.",Dan Tow,Technology,2003-11-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dOYPtfVqS_MC&source=gbs_api

SQL and Relational Theory,"SQL is full of difficulties and traps for the unwary. You can avoid them if you understand relational theory, but only if you know how to put the theory into practice. In this insightful book, author C.J. Date explains relational theory in depth, and demonstrates through numerous examples and exercises how you can apply it directly to your use of SQL. This second edition includes new material on recursive queries, “missing information” without nulls, new update operators, and topics such as aggregate operators, grouping and ungrouping, and view updating. If you have a modest-to-advanced background in SQL, you’ll learn how to deal with a host of common SQL dilemmas. Why is proper column naming so important? Nulls in your database are causing you to get wrong answers. Why? What can you do about it? Is it possible to write an SQL query to find employees who have never been in the same department for more than six months at a time? SQL supports “quantified comparisons,” but they’re better avoided. Why? How do you avoid them? Constraints are crucially important, but most SQL products don’t support them properly. What can you do to resolve this situation? Database theory and practice have evolved since the relational model was developed more than 40 years ago. SQL and Relational Theory draws on decades of research to present the most up-to-date treatment of SQL available. C.J. Date has a stature that is unique within the database industry. A prolific writer well known for the bestselling textbook An Introduction to Database Systems (Addison-Wesley), he has an exceptionally clear style when writing about complex principles and theory.",C.

Machine Learning,"A concise overview of machine learning—computer programs that learn from data—which underlies applications that include recommendation systems, face recognition, and driverless cars. Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition—as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as “Big Data” has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning—the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge—has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications.

Regulating Artificial Intelligence,"This book assesses the normative and practical challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) regulation, offers comprehensive information on the laws that currently shape or restrict the design or use of AI, and develops policy recommendations for those areas in which regulation is most urgently needed. By gathering contributions from scholars who are experts in their respective fields of legal research, it demonstrates that AI regulation is not a specialized sub-discipline, but affects the entire legal system and thus concerns all lawyers. Machine learning-based technology, which lies at the heart of what is commonly referred to as AI, is increasingly being employed to make policy and business decisions with broad social impacts, and therefore runs the risk of causing wide-scale damage. At the same time, AI technology is becoming more and more complex and difficult to understand, making it harder to determine whether or not it is being used in accordance with the law. In light of this situation, even tech enthusiasts are calling for stricter regulation of AI. Legislators, too, are stepping in and have begun to pass AI laws, including the prohibition of automated decision-making systems in Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the New York City AI transparency bill, and the 2017 amendments to the German Cartel Act and German Administrative Procedure Act. While the belief that something needs to be done is widely shared, there is far less clarity about what exactly can or should be done, or what effective regulation might look like. The book is divided into two major parts, the first of which focuses on features common to most AI systems, and explores how they relate to the legal framework for data-driven technologies, which already exists in the form of (national and supra-national) constitutional law, EU data protection and competition law, and anti-discrimination law. In the second part, the book examines in detail a number of relevant sectors in which AI is increasingly shaping decision-making processes, ranging from the notorious social media and the legal, financial and healthcare industries, to fields like law enforcement and tax law, in which we can observe how regulation by AI is becoming a reality.",Thomas Wischmeyer,Technology,2019-11-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FQ3BDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Artificial Intelligence,"Melanie Mitchell separates science fact from science fiction in this sweeping examination of the current state of AI and how it is remaking our world No recent scientific enterprise has proved as alluring, terrifying, and filled with extravagant promise and frustrating setbacks as artificial intelligence. The award-winning author Melanie Mitchell, a leading computer scientist, now reveals AI’s turbulent history and the recent spate of apparent successes, grand hopes, and emerging fears surrounding it. In Artificial Intelligence, Mitchell turns to the most urgent questions concerning AI today: How intelligent—really—are the best AI programs? How do they work? What can they actually do, and when do they fail? How humanlike do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us? Along the way, she introduces the dominant models of modern AI and machine learning, describing cutting-edge AI programs, their human inventors, and the historical lines of thought underpinning recent achievements. She meets with fellow experts such as Douglas Hofstadter, the cognitive scientist and Pulitzer Prize–winning author of the modern classic Gödel, Escher, Bach, who explains why he is “terrified” about the future of AI. She explores the profound disconnect between the hype and the actual achievements in AI, providing a clear sense of what the field has accomplished and how much further it has to go. Interweaving stories about the science of AI and the people behind it, Artificial Intelligence brims with clear-sighted, captivating, and accessible accounts of the most interesting and provocative modern work in the field, flavored with Mitchell’s humor and personal observations. This frank, lively book is an indispensable guide to understanding today’s AI, its quest for “human-level” intelligence, and its impact on the future for us all.",Melanie Mitchell,Technology,2020-11-17,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=asyxzAEACAAJ&dq=Artificial+Intelligence&hl=&source=gbs_api

Mastering GitHub Pages,"Why should you read Mastering GitHub Pages: A Beginner’s Guide? Because this book offers you a concise guide so that you can quickly navigate the terrains of GitHub Pages sites in a fairly smooth manner. But why use GitHub Pages if it can only make static websites? Why should you go for static websites when you could get a dynamic one made for your organization? Again, why not?! Having a static website is a sure-shot strategy to save a lot of money, keep the website secure, and ensure built-in backups. In addition, you can serve it over HTTPS and make sure that it is fast and SEO-ready. Mastering GitHub Pages delves into static (and dynamic) websites as well as their advantages and disadvantages. Static websites tend to be incredibly fast since they have no processing time for databases and other stuff. Additionally, because you are committing a code base of static assets to a Git repository, the rolling back of changes is simply an issue involving reversion to a commit that was made previously. So backups are a mere git push away, and you are basically serving your entire website from a cache. This means that your server will never need to process a request again. This book helps you master the art of static site generation in no time. Furthermore, Mastering GitHub Pages also discusses in great length Jekyll, a popular static site generator. When working with Jekyll, all you do is give it liquid templates as well as Markdown content, and it is adept at combining them both into a static website. It requires no-on-the-fly processing, and your blog will display at a significantly faster speed. This workflow proves useful for GitHub Pages because they tend to support the Jekyll builds. As such, your blog posts can be contributed using pull requests, and all your content gets stored within version control. Non-developers could also contribute posts in Markdown. Mastering GitHub Pages is an immensely useful book that all developers can use for the creation of websites on the free GitHub Pages platform. So, go ahead, grab a copy of the book for a proper GitHub Pages primer!
