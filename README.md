# Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System developed using Tkinter for the GUI, making it easy to use. Additionally, some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been incorporated for book searching.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to open the GUI for the Library Management System:

1. Clone this repository using the following shell command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Ehteesham/library_system.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Open the terminal/command prompt in the project directory.

3. Run the `app.py` file using the following command:

```shell
python app.py
```

4. The Library Management System GUI should now open. You can either log in if you have an existing account or register as a new user.

## Usage

Once you've logged in, you'll find an instructional manual on the top-right side of the interface. This manual provides additional information about using the library system.

## Data Storage

This project does not use a traditional database system. Instead, it stores all the information in CSV files located in the `Data` directory. You can find the data files in this directory.
